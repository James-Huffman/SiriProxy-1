Hello, This plugin allows you to wake up other computers on your LAN.

THIS REQUIRES CONFIGURATION before you use it. Edit the config.csv file in the lib folder with your computer's info, including:

Name: must start with an upper case letter

MAC Address: 2 digits, followed by a :

Broadcast range: whatever subnet you are on.

and then leave local as true and port as 9.



Any questions, ask on twitter: @ian_mcdowell
